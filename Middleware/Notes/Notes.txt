Middleware

--What is Middleware?
	> Component that is assembled into the application pipeline to handle requests and responses.
	> Middlewares are chained one-after-other and execute in the sane sequence how they're added.
	> Each middleware peforms a single operation implementing single responsibility principle.
	> Middleware can be a request delegate (anonymous method or lambda expression) [or] a class.
	> Middlewares also don't have to forward the request to the subsequent middleware if it doesn't have to. This middleware is called terminal middleware or short-circuiting middleware.

--Middleware Chain
	> Middlewares can be chained one after another.
	> This is optional.
	> next() forwards the Http context to the next middleware. 
	> App.Use() allows forwarding to subsequent middleware.
	> App.Run() does not allow forwarding to the subsequent middleware.
	> After the request hits the terminating middleware, the response is sent back up throught the chain. 
	> If code is present after any next() calls, that code will run as the response is being sent back up.

--Middleware Class
	> Middleware class is used to separate the middleware logic from a lambda expression to a separate/reuseable class.
	> Format:
		****
			class MiddlewareClassName : IMiddleware
			{
				public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
				{
					//before logic

					await next(context);

					//after logic
				}
			}
		****

--Middleware Extensions
	> Middleware extension method is used to invoke the middleware with a single method call.
	> Format:
		****
			static class ClassName 
			{
				public static IApplicationBuilder ExtensionMethodName(this IApplicationBuilder app)
				{
					return app.UseMiddleware<ClassName>();
				}
			}
		****

--Conventional Middleware
	> Format:
		****
			class MiddlewareClassName
			{
				private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
				public MiddlewareClassName(RequestDelegate next)
				{
					_next = next;
				}

				public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
				{
					//before logic
					
					await _next(context);

					//after logic
				}
			}
