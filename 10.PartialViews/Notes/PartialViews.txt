Partial Views

--What is a Partial View?
    > A Partial View is a razor markup file (.cshtml) that can't be invoked 
    individually from the controller, but can be invoked from any view within 
    the same web application.
    
--The Different Ways to Invoke Partial Views
    > Format:
        *****
            <partial name="partial view name"></partial>
        *****
            >> Returns the content to the parent view.
            
    > Format:
        *****
            await Html.PartialAsync("partial view name")
        *****
            >> Returns the content to the parent view.
            
    > Format:
        *****
            @{
                await Html.RenderPartialAsync("partial view name");
            }
        *****
            >> Streams the content to the browser.
            
    > The differences between RenderPartialAsync and the other 2 methods is that
     the other 2 methods return the content to the parent view. 
     RenderPartialAsync returns void because it streams the content to the 
     browser. 
     
     > RenderPartialAsync improves the performance in larger scale code.
     
     > The other 2 methods return IHtml content so its possible to store them in
      a variable.
