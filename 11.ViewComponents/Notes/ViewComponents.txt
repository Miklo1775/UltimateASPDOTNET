View Components

--What is a View Component?
    > A View Component is a combination of a class (derived from Microsoft
    .AspNetCore.ViewComponent) that supplies data, and a partial view to render 
    that data.
    > Renders a chunk rather than a whole response.
    > Includes the same separation-of-concerns and testability found with a 
    controller and view.
    > Should be either suffixed with the word "ViewComponent" or should have 
    [ViewComponent] attribute.
    > Optionally, can inherit from System.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewComponent
    
--Invoking View Components
    > Format:
        *****
            @await Component.InvokeAsync("view component name");
        *****
        
    > Format:
        *****
            <vc:component-name />
        *****
        
--View Components with ViewData
    > The ViewComponent class can share ViewData object to the ViewComponent 
    view.
    
--Strongly Typed ViewComponent
    > A Strongly Typed ViewComponents view is tightly bound to a specified model
     class so it gets all the benefits of a strongly typed view.
