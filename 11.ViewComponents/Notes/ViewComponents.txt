View Components

--What is a View Component?
    > A View Component is a combination of a class (derived from Microsoft
    .AspNetCore.ViewComponent) that supplies data, and a partial view to render 
    that data.
    > Renders a chunk rather than a whole response.
    > Includes the same separation-of-concerns and testability found with a 
    controller and view.
    > Should be either suffixed with the word "ViewComponent" or should have 
    [ViewComponent] attribute.
    > Optionally, can inherit from System.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewComponent
