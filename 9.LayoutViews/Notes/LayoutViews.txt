Layout Views

--What is a Layout View?
    > A Layout View is a web page (.cshtml) that is responsible for containing 
    presentation logic template (commonly the html template with header, 
    sidebar, footer, etc)
    
--Order of Views Execution
    > _ViewImports.cshtml
    > _ViewStart.cshtml
    > View.cshtml
    > LayoutView.cshtml
    
 --More on Layout Views
    > @RenderBody() method presents only in layout view to represent the place 
    where exactly content from the view has to be rendered.
    > The "Layout" property of the view specifies path of the layout view. It 
    can be dynamically set in the view.
    > Both View and Layout View shares the ViewData object. So it is possible to
     send data from view to layout, since the view executes first.
    > The css/js files imported in layout view will be applicable to view also, 
    because the content of view will be merged into the layout view at runtime.
    
 --Layout Views - Sections
    > Section defines the content in the view, to be rendered in a specific 
    place in the layout view.
    > Sections can be rendered as optional by using the parameter: false 
    parameter.
    > Format:
        *****
            @section section_name
            {
                // section content here
            }
                        ||
                        \/
            @RenderSection("section_name")
        *****
    > One common use-case for using sections is importing a script file for a 
   certain view. We don't want to import that script file for all the views, so 
   we can use sections as a way of importing that file in certain views.
