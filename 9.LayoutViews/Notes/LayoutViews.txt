    > @RenderBody() method presents only in layout view to represent the place 
    where exactly content from the view has to be rendered.
    > The "Layout" property of the view specifies path of the layout view. It 
    can be dynamically set in the view.
    > Both View and Layout View shares the ViewData object. So it is possible to
     send data from view to layout, since the view executes first.
    > The css/js files imported in layout view will be applicable to view also, 
    because the content of view will be merged into the layout view at runtime.
